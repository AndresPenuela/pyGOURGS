## Global Optimization by Uniform Random Global Search

This software package solves problems whose solutions can be represented as 
n-ary trees. These problems are typically solved using genetic programming. 
For these problems, there is often little to no relationship between the data
structure representation of a candidate solution and the ultimate performance of 
the candidate solution, once the data structure representation has been 
evaluated to its human readable form. This makes pure random search an 
attractive algorithm with which to solve these kinds of problems. This software 
is aimed at engineers, researchers and data scientists working in data analysis 
and computational optimization.


## Features 

1. Can also run an exhaustive/brute-force search
2. Can be run in deterministic mode for reproducibility
3. Developed and tested on Python 3.6
