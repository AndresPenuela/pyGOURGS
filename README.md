## IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

## Global Optimization by Uniform Random Global Search

## Features 

1. Robust parameter fitting
2. Multiprocessing for speed
3. Memoization for speed
4. Loads data from CSV files
5. Results saved to SQLite file. 
6. Results of new runs are added to results of old runs.
7. User specified number of fitting parameters.
8. User specified operator functions of arbitrary arity
9. Can also run an exhaustive/brute-force search
10. Can be run in deterministic mode for reproducibility
11. Developed and tested on Python 3.6
